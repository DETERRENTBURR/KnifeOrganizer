# ‚úÇÔ∏è Hanging Stand for Utility Knives and Blades

## Project Overview

This project presents a **hanging stand** designed to organize utility knives and their replacement blades. The stand is both practical and space-saving, providing a convenient solution for safely storing sharp tools in an easily accessible manner.  

The design process involved multiple iterations to optimize material usage and improve structural integrity. For instance, the base was initially solid, which consumed excessive material. It was redesigned with a hollow structure to minimize waste. Additionally, the knife holders were made hollow (with through-holes) to reduce stress at their connection points, preventing potential breakage.

## üé® Design and Creation Process

### Designed in Rhino
The stand was modeled in **Rhino**, incorporating both practical and aesthetic considerations. Early prototypes revealed issues with material usage and weak points in the design:  
- **Base Optimization**: The originally solid base was made hollow to save material and reduce print time.  
- **Knife Holder Strength**: The holders were initially solid but prone to breakage at their connection points. Adding through-holes distributed stress more evenly and improved durability.

### Printed with Prusa
The optimized design was printed on a **Prusa 3D printer** using **PrusaSlicer**. Due to the stand‚Äôs size and complexity, the printing process took approximately **8 hours**.

## üì∏ Final Result

The final product is a robust and functional hanging stand that can hold multiple utility knives and blade packs securely. It‚Äôs ideal for workshops, offices, or hobby spaces where organization and accessibility are key. The updated design ensures material efficiency and long-term durability.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Download the STL file and load it into your 3D slicer software.
2. Set up your printing parameters.  
   - *Note: Due to the size, ensure your printer bed is large enough.*  
3. Print the model (approx. **8 hours printing time**).  
4. Mount the stand in a suitable location using screws or adhesive.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

- **Strength and Rigidity Analysis**: Perform stress and stiffness calculations in **ANSYS Mechanical** to ensure the stand's reliability under load.  
- **Adding Chamfers**: Introduce chamfers in the design for better aesthetics, improved ergonomics, and reduced stress concentrations.  
- **Customizable Hooks**: Add adjustable or modular hooks to accommodate a wider range of tools (e.g., scissors, rulers).  
- **Modular Design**: Explore a sectional design for easier printing and assembly.  
- **Material Experimentation**: Test alternative materials for enhanced strength and flexibility.
